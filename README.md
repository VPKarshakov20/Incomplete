Download the game from [github](https://github.com/VPKarshakov20/Incomplete) by pressing the green clone button. 
Unfortunately we aren't able to upload the executable file, so we are uploading a [video of the project](https://codingburgas-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mikafedzhiev20_codingburgas_bg/ETGUXj4L-zpAvw8w0KiuD9MBGPXhHYPV6eHsEw95Ec-fzg?e=E0noGd).

1. We coudn't finish it on time.
2. sometimes we couldn't get the assets to load.
3. Qt was making problems (deleting methods, giving errors for no reason, etc).
4. We had a hard time finding team members.
5. Some of the commits are verified.
6. Some team members were working more than others.
7. We have commits past the deadline.

 For programming language we used C++.
